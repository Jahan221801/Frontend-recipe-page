## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this page, I improved my understanding of:

- Using **semantic HTML** for better accessibility and structure
- Creating a responsive layout using **media queries**
- Styling sections and components with **CSS custom properties** for cleaner code
- Building visually appealing designs without relying on external frameworks

Hereâ€™s a sample snippet I liked using:

```css
.main1 {
  max-width: 700px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: white; 
  border-radius: 12px;
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
